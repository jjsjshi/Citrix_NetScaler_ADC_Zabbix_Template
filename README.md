## Getting Started

To begin using the Citrix NetScaler ADC Zabbix Template, you can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/jjsjshi/Citrix_NetScaler_ADC_Zabbix_Template/releases). Download the necessary files and follow the installation steps below.

## Installation

1. **Download the Template**: Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/jjsjshi/Citrix_NetScaler_ADC_Zabbix_Template/releases) section to get the latest version of the template.
2. **Upload to Zabbix**: Log in to your Zabbix web interface. Navigate to **Configuration > Templates** and click on **Import**.
3. **Select File**: Choose the downloaded template file and click **Import**.
4. **Link to Hosts**: After importing, link the template to the relevant hosts that you want to monitor.

## Configuration

### SNMP Configuration

Ensure that your Citrix NetScaler ADC is configured to allow SNMP access. This typically involves:

- Enabling SNMP on the NetScaler.
- Configuring SNMP communities.
- Setting the appropriate permissions.

### Zabbix Configuration

1. **Host Configuration**: In Zabbix, go to **Configuration > Hosts** and select the host.
2. **Link Template**: Link the Citrix NetScaler ADC template to the host.
3. **Set SNMP Interface**: Make sure to configure the SNMP interface for the host.

## Usage

Once you have completed the installation and configuration, you can start monitoring your Citrix NetScaler ADC. Zabbix will begin collecting data based on the predefined metrics in the template.
